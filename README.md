This project is a simple weather app utilizing basic front-end technologies (HTML, CSS, SCSS, JS, jQuery) in junction with the Open Weather API. This weather application acts as a way for users to input a city of their choice and recent up-to-date information. Users will be presented with the current day's weather information in addition to a five day forecast. This application also utilizes the Moment.js library to provide well-formatted dates.
